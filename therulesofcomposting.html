                <h2>The Rules Of Composting</h2>
                <h3>Rule 1: To Learn Compost, One Must Compost</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li>Select a dry shady area that is away from your house but close 
                        enough for your garden hose to reach. Though you can buy a simple
                         bin or tumbler that makes turning your compost a breeze, you can 
                         also compost directly on the ground. 
                        Some recommend adding a base layer of mulch, woody or bushy material
                        , to promote aeration, but that’s optional.</li>
                        
                        <li> Alternate layers of brown (carbon) and green
                             (nitrogen) material and aim for a 4:1 ratio of browns to 
                             greens. Browns include dry leaves, sawdust or small
                              wood chips, and shredded newspaper or cardboard. Greens include grass clippings,
                               food waste, and garden waste like weeds or green trimmings. Aim for layers 
                               that are a few inches deep and use your garden hose to moisten the material
                                as you build. Make sure any food scraps are covered with a layer of brown
                                 materials to prevent flies and smells.
                        </li>
                        
                        Alternate layers of brown (carbon) and green (nitrogen) material and aim for a 4:1 ratio of browns to greens. Browns include dry leaves, sawdust or small wood chips, and shredded newspaper or cardboard. Greens include grass clippings, food waste, and garden waste like weeds or green trimmings. Aim for layers that are a few inches deep and use your garden hose to moisten the material as you build. Make sure any food scraps are covered with a layer of brown materials to prevent flies and smells.
                        
                        3. Mix Often and Keep It Moist
                        
                        The more often you mix or turn your pile, the faster it will decompose. You can use a shovel or a rake to mix. Be sure to mix the pile thoroughly at a minimum of once every two weeks. And use your garden hose to add moisture if you notice your pile is dry. It should be damp like a wrung out sponge.
                        
                        4. Cover to Retain Heat, Moisture, and Nutrients
                        
                        Cover your pile with a tarp or an old scrap of carpet. This will trap the heat and aid your compost in cooking. It will also prevent nutrient loss in case it rains. While rain is a welcome sight for your plants, it will wash the nutrients out of your compost and deposit them into the ground below.
                        
                        5. Optional: Accelerate the Breakdown
                        
                        If you want your compost to be viable by the beginning of summer, you can add a compost accelerator to speed up the breakdown process. It’s a simple solution of sugar water, ammonia, and beer – which is why some refer to this method as “drunk composting”.</li>
