                <h2> What Is Composting?</h2>
                
                <p>Composting is a simple way of turning non-usuable material into usable material.</p>

                <h3>Reduces landfill waste</h3>
                <p>Composting hel[s divert materials from going to landfills, minimizing the amount of greenhouse gases emissions released 
                into the atmosphere and increasing the capacity of landfills.</p>

                <h4>Retains more water</h4>
                <p>Compost helps strengthens soil's ability to retain water. This causes plants to not be watered as frequently.</p>

                <h5>Reduces soil erusion</h5>
                <p>erusion occurs when top soil is blown or washed away causing infertile topsoil. Compost can restore topsoil and build a stable soil structure.</p>

                <h6>Reduces need for synthetic fertilizers</h6>
                <p>Compost sufficiently supplies soil nutriens likephosphorus and nitrogen. This reduces the need for additional fertizlier because compost naturally provides the necessary
                nutriens for the soil.</p>

                <h8>Helps Carbon Sequestration</h8>
                <p>Carbon is stored in the top 3 feet of soil and is released into the atmosphere when soil structure is poor. Applied compost helps improve the soil 
                structure to combat against carbon.</p>

                <h9>Why Should You Compost?</h9>
                    <p>You should compost because enriches soil and promotes healthy
                         plant growth, plants grown in compost-rich soil tend to be more
                          resilient to diseases, pests, and fungi.</p>
