            Having a good understanding of the natural process that turns raw organic <br> materials into
            rich soil is essential for any gardener or farmer. One method of achieving <br>this is through 
            aerated composting, which involves introducing airflow into the compost pile. <br>In addition to 
            airflow, heat is also necessary to destroy pathogens, weed seeds, and parasites, <br>all of which 
            can be harmful to plants. Pathogens are disease-causing germs that should not be <br>introduced into
            the soil, while parasites, such as worms, can be beneficial for soil health. However, <br> not all worms
            are equal, and gardeners may prefer specific species, such as Eisenia foetida and Lumbricus<br>
            rubellus, over others. Ultimately, creating rich soil is a complex and ongoing <br>
            process that requires a combination of knowledge, skill, and patience.<br>

          <div style="padding:6px;">
          <p>
            When it comes to composting, oxygen is a vital component in the process. <br>
            Aerobic composting involves the decomposition of organic matter using microorganisms that <br> 
            requires oxygen to break down the materials. This process not only creates nutrient-rich <br>
            soil but also produces heat that can destroy pathogens, parasites, and weed seeds. <br>
            To ensure the oxygen level in the compost pile remains at 10% or higher, it's important <br>
             to turn the compost regularly. Interestingly, the air we breathe at sea level contains <br>
             20% oxygen, making it abundantly clear how crucial oxygen is to the composting process. <br>
             To start the composting process, fill the bin with your mix and take a temperature reading <br>
             to establish your starting point. Once you turn the blower on, you should see a change in <br>
              temperature from 300 to 500 degrees Fahrenheit within 12 to 24 hours. <br>
             Following these simple steps will help you create nutrient-rich soil for your plants and garden. <br>

        <p>
            Water is often referred to as the "magic ingredient" in composting, and <br>
            for good reason. Aerobic microorganisms, which are essential to the <br>
            composting process, require a film of water to live and thrive. This film<br> 
            of water allows populations of fungi and bacteria to grow rapidly throughout<br>
            the compost pile, breaking down organic matter into nutrient-rich soil. <br>
            Additionally, water plays a critical role in reducing the odor of the compost<br>
            pile. However, it's important to get the water content just right. <br>
            If the compost pile is too wet, with a water content over 65%, the pore <br> 
            spaces will open up, and the excess water will result in terrible odors. <br>
            On the other hand, if the compost pile is too dry, with a water content <br>
            below 50%, the microbiology of the system will crash, and it will not work. <br>
            While a dry pile will eventually happen, it can be renewed by adding water, but not<br>
            too much. Achieving the perfect water content in the compost pile is crucial for <br>
            creating healthy, nutrient-rich soil. <br>

            Composting has two stages: the active phase and the curing phase. The active phase lasts for 21 to <br>
            30 days and is led by bacteria that break down sugars, proteins, and carbohydrates, generating <br>
            heat. The curing phase is dominated by fungi that break down the remaining organic matter. It can <br>
            take several months, and during this phase, mushrooms may grow, and white filamentous material may be <br>
            visible in the pile. The curing phase is crucial to create stable and usable compost for gardening. <br>
