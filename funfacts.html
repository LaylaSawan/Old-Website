                <h2>Their are many amazing facts for composting, these are some of my favourites:</h2>
                <h3>Reduces Flood Risk</h3>
                <p>

                        Making composting can reduce flood risks becuase increased infiltration, 
                        it prevents water from laterally flowing off the land, and potentially into 
                        storm drains and sewers

                </p>
                <h4>Improves Soil Structure</h4>
                <p>

                    Compost increases the organic matter in the soil. Studies have 
                    shown this improves maximum yield potential & workability and 
                    provides better crop establishment. 

                </p>
                <h5>Sequester Carbon</h5>

                <p>

                     When compost is applied, it increases soil health, as microbes
                     grow and become more plentiful. Using compost is an effective
                     way to sequester carbon, storing it in the soil instead of 
                     releasing it into the air.
