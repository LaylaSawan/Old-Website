              <h3>Aeration</h3>
              <h4>What Is Aeration?</h4>
              <p> 
                Aeration is necessary in high temperature aerobic composting for rapid odor-free decomposition. 
                Aeration is also useful in reducing high initial moisture content in composting materials.</p>
              <p1>Key points to aeration</p1>
              <ul>
                <li>Mitigates problems with offensive odors.</li>
                <li>Degrades vaccines, antibiotics, deworming products and pesticides.</li>
                <li>Controls the pile temperature, destroying pathogens, parasites and weed seeds.</li>
                <li>Significantly increases the rate of composting.</li>
                <li>Converts a raw waste into a humus-rich soil </li>
              </ul>  
              <h5>How To Make An aerated Compost Pile</h5>
              <p>
                An aerated pile of composting should be over 550C (1310F) for a minimum of 
                3-4 days to ensure that there is pathogen destruction and to produce a safe product.
              </p>

              <p>
                When air is first introduced into a (non-aerated) compost pile, the microorganisms that are 
                already in the mix go crazy and go over 1500F in less than 24 hours. I should take advantage
                of this heat and make it destroy pathogens, parasites and weed seeds.
              </p>

              <p>
                With aeration, the increased number and diversity of microorganisms greatly quicken the composting process. 
                With aerated composting, the active phase typically lasts 21 to 30 days and the subsequent 
                curing phase lasts an additional 30 to 60 days.
              </p>

              <p>
                It should be your goal goal to maintain the oxygen level at 8% or higher. 
                The main by-products are water, heat, carbon and dioxide. 
                With aerobic composting, the quality of the odor is often described as peasant.
